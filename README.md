# Handheld USB Link

Two retro handhelds, one USB cable, no Wi-Fi or PC in between:

- **[Handheld Link](handheld-link/README.md)** (new in 0.3.0): browse the
  other handheld and send it ROMs, saves, save states, game art, apps and
  settings, from either side. For FunKey OS handhelds (RG Nano, GBA Mini,
  FunKey S clones) so far.
- **USB Netplay:** RetroArch netplay and the Game Boy link cable over the
  cable, on ROCKNIX, KNULLI, Batocera, AmberELEC, dArkOS and muOS.

Both use the same cabling: an OTG adapter on the handheld that is the USB
host, and a normal USB cable to the other one. This project used to be
called handheld-usb-netplay; old links still lead here.

## Handheld Link

![Browsing the other handheld's games](docs/images/handheld-link-games.png)

Install `HandheldLink-<version>.opk` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/DankMiimer/handheld-usb-link/releases/latest)
into **Applications** on both handhelds, connect them (OTG adapter on the RG
Nano), and open **Handheld Link** on both. **L / R** switches between the
two handhelds, **A** marks games, **Start** sends them. If a file is already
there, it asks what to do. Everything else, including what goes where and
the speed, is in [handheld-link/README.md](handheld-link/README.md).

## USB Netplay

RetroArch netplay between two Linux retro handhelds over a USB cable instead
of Wi-Fi. Install it on both handhelds, run it once from the menu, plug the
cable in, then host and join as usual. The cable gives about 2 ms ping,
where the same pair over Wi-Fi measured about 28 ms. It needs no router, and
it works on handhelds without Wi-Fi, such as R36S clones.

It is a menu script, not a firmware patch. It works out what each handheld
can do, picks the right way to link them, and lets RetroArch find the other
handheld by itself. **USB Netplay - Remove** undoes every change it made.

### What you need

- Two handhelds on firmware from the [support table](#which-handhelds-work-netplay).
  At least one of them must be able to act as the **USB device**.
- An **OTG adapter** (USB-C or micro-USB male to USB-A female) and a normal
  USB-A cable to the other handheld's data port.
- The **same game and the same core build** on both. Netplay desyncs or
  refuses to connect otherwise. USB Netplay's status screen lists the core
  checksums so you can compare them.

#### Cable safety

- **The OTG adapter goes on the USB host**, the handheld that powers the link.
  The other handheld is the USB device.
- **Don't link two handhelds with a plain USB-C to USB-C cable.** Most
  handhelds don't negotiate USB-C roles properly, so neither side decides who
  supplies 5 V or who is the host. The adapter settles both.
- On handhelds with two USB-C ports, use the right one. The Anbernic RG DS,
  for example, can only be the USB device on its charging port and only the
  host on its other port.
- **Unplug before you switch a handheld's USB networking off.** With the
  cable in, a ROCKNIX R36S clone froze when its USB mode was turned off,
  because that makes both ends USB hosts.

### Install

Download `usb-netplay-<version>.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/DankMiimer/handheld-usb-link/releases/latest).
Unpack it into the **Ports** folder, so that `USB Netplay.sh`,
`USB Netplay - Remove.sh` and the `usb-netplay` folder sit side by side.

| Firmware | Ports folder |
|---|---|
| ROCKNIX, JELOS, AmberELEC | `roms/ports` on the games card (`/storage/roms/ports`) |
| KNULLI, Batocera | `roms/ports` on the share (`/userdata/roms/ports`) |
| dArkOS, ArkOS | `ports` on the EASYROMS card (`/roms/ports`), or `tools`, which shows under Options > Tools |
| muOS (experimental) | make a folder `MUOS/application/USB Netplay/`, put the `usb-netplay` folder in it, and copy `USB Netplay.sh` there as `mux_launch.sh` |

If the entries don't show up, refresh the game list (KNULLI and Batocera:
Game Settings > Update Gamelists) or restart the frontend.

### How to play

1. On **both** handhelds, open **Ports > USB Netplay**. It sets itself up and
   shows a status screen (where it can, the screen closes by itself after 25
   seconds). If the status says *Restart this handheld once*, do that.
   On a ROCKNIX handheld that will be the USB device, also set its USB mode
   to **network** in its network settings. USB Netplay sets the address.
2. Plug the cable in, with the OTG adapter on the host side.
3. On one handheld, start the game and choose
   **RetroArch menu > Netplay > Host**.
4. On the other handheld, start the same game with the same core and choose
   **Netplay > Connect to Netplay Host**. The address is already filled in:
   it is the name `usb-netplay`, which always points at the handheld on the
   other end of the cable. **Refresh Netplay Host List** works too, and it
   also switches to the host's core.

With the ADB tunnel (a KNULLI H700 or A133 handheld as the USB device), only
one direction works: the handheld with the OTG adapter hosts, and the KNULLI
handheld joins.

When the cable link comes up or goes down, a short notice appears in the
menu on ROCKNIX, AmberELEC, KNULLI and Batocera.

Run **USB Netplay** again whenever you like. It repairs its setup and shows
the link, the other handheld's address and the ping. When the other handheld
runs USB Netplay too, the status also compares the two:
- which netplay cores are the same build on both, and which differ (those can
  refuse to connect or desync);
- systems whose games start with a different default core on each side.
  **Connect to Netplay Host** fails there with "host is running another core". The join message tells
you which way you connected: a ping of about 2 ms means the cable, 20 ms and
up means Wi-Fi. A game that is already running stays on Wi-Fi until you
rejoin.

#### Game Boy link cable (GB and GBC)

On ROCKNIX, KNULLI and Batocera, USB Netplay also sets up the Game Boy link
cable for the Gambatte core (trading and battling Pokémon, 2-player Tetris,
and so on). While a cable link is up, the USB host is the link server and the
USB device connects to it, through the ADB tunnel too. Start the games after
the cable is linked; RetroArch reads the setting when a game starts.

1. Start the game on the **USB host** first, then on the other handheld.
2. Wait about **30 seconds**. Gambatte's server only looks for its partner
   now and then.
3. Start the link move (2 PLAYER, the Cable Club...) on the **USB host
   only**. If both sides start it at once, both act as the sender and one of
   them freezes until the other game quits.

The status says which side this handheld is. On an RG Nano running USB Link,
set picoarch's Gambatte options by hand:
- Game Link Mode: Network Client
- port: 56400
- server address: 010.170.000.006, the RG DS end of the Nano's link.

`GBLINK=no` in `settings.conf` leaves Gambatte's settings alone.

#### Playing against a PC

A handheld in ROCKNIX's USB network mode also works as a network adapter for
a PC. Windows 11 and Linux recognise it without a driver install, and the PC
gets its address from the handheld. Plug the handheld into the PC with a
normal cable (the PC is the USB host), host the game on the handheld, and on
the PC choose **Connect to Netplay Host** with the handheld's cable address.
The status shows it as "its cable address is 10.x.y.2". The PC's RetroArch
must run the same core build as the handheld, so copy the handheld's core
over if netplay refuses to connect or desyncs.

#### Settings (optional)

Copy `usb-netplay/settings.example.conf` to `usb-netplay/settings.conf` and
edit the copy, so that updates don't overwrite it. Then run USB Netplay
again.

- `FALLBACK_HOST=` is where `usb-netplay` points while no cable is plugged
  in, for example the Wi-Fi address of the handheld you usually play against.
  Leave it empty and **Connect to Netplay Host** only works over the cable
  (the host list still works on Wi-Fi).
- `NOTIFY=no` turns off the notices when the cable link comes up or goes
  down.
- `GBLINK=no` leaves the Game Boy core's link settings alone.

#### Removing it

Run **Ports > USB Netplay - Remove**. It restores every file it changed from
its own record of the changes, then deletes its installed copy. You can then
delete the files from Ports.

### Which handhelds work (netplay)

A link always has one **USB host** (the side with the OTG adapter) and one
**USB device**. USB Netplay checks what each handheld can do when it runs,
and says so plainly if a handheld can't take part.

**Tested** on real hardware, with a real netplay join over the cable:

| USB host (OTG adapter) | USB device | How they link | Also tested |
|---|---|---|---|
| ROCKNIX, RK3566 (Anbernic RG DS) | ROCKNIX, RK3326 (R36S clone, AurkNix build) | ROCKNIX's own USB network gadget, address by DHCP | replug, reboot with the cable in |
| ROCKNIX, RK3566 (Anbernic RG DS) | KNULLI, H700 (Anbernic RG34XX-SP) | ADB tunnel (the H700 kernel has no USB network gadget); the RG DS hosts | replug, reboot of both*; Game Boy link (Tetris 2-player) through the tunnel; core comparison over ADB |
| ROCKNIX, RK3566 (Anbernic RG DS) | FunKey OS (RG Nano, USB Link app) | the Nano's fixed address; no netplay on the Nano | Game Boy link (Tetris 2-player), set by hand on the Nano |
| KNULLI, H700 (Anbernic RG34XX-SP) | ROCKNIX, RK3326 (R36S clone) | ROCKNIX's own USB network gadget, address by DHCP | |

\* The replug and reboot of the RG DS and RG34XX-SP pair were tested with the
hand-built setup this tool grew out of. With the tool itself, that pair was
tested with a join.

**Expected to work, from the firmware source code (untested):**

| Firmware | Can be the USB device | Can be the USB host | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ROCKNIX / JELOS, every SoC except RK3399 | yes, its own USB network mode | yes | ROCKNIX's USB mode must be *network* (USB Netplay sets the address) |
| KNULLI H700, A133 | yes, through ADB | yes | the USB mode must stay *ADB* (the default), and this handheld joins rather than hosts. The host on the other end needs python3 (ROCKNIX, AmberELEC, KNULLI and dArkOS all have it) |
| KNULLI RK3566, RK3568, SM8250 | yes, own gadget | yes | with KNULLI's USB mode off; in ADB mode it works like the H700 |
| Batocera H700, RK3568, SM8250 | yes, own gadget | yes | |
| AmberELEC | no | yes | |
| dArkOS / ArkOS RK3326 | no | yes | the OTG port is host-only unless the device tree is edited, which USB Netplay never does |
| dArkOS RK3566 | no | yes | |
| KNULLI / Batocera RK3326 | no | yes | the kernel has no USB gadget support |
| muOS 2606+ | muOS Device Link only (muOS to muOS) | probably | experimental; the boot hook needs Settings > Advanced > User Init |

**Not supported:**

- ROCKNIX on RK3399: no USB network gadget and no NCM host driver.
- SpruceOS: no USB network gadget and no boot hook.
- Onion (Miyoo Mini): the USB-C port carries no USB data.
- Two handhelds that can only be the host, such as an AmberELEC and a dArkOS
  handheld. One side must be able to be the USB device.
- The RG Nano (FunKey OS) has no RetroArch netplay. Its
  [USB Link](https://github.com/DankMiimer/rg-nano-adb-tools) app (with
  `NETWORK=ncm`) can still bring up a cable link to it. USB Netplay finds the
  Nano at its default address. Tested with an RG DS as the host: the link was
  up 8 seconds after the Nano's network interface appeared, ping about 2 ms.

Tried it on another handheld? Please open an issue with `last-run.txt` from
the `usb-netplay` folder, whether it worked or not.

### Troubleshooting

- **"Host is running another core".** **Connect to Netplay Host** keeps the
  core you started with. Set the same default core on both handhelds (for
  example Nestopia for NES; KNULLI defaults to FCEUmm, ROCKNIX to Nestopia),
  or join from **Refresh Netplay Host List**, which switches cores.
- **The game desyncs or jumps.** The two handhelds have different builds of
  the same core. The status names those cores when both handhelds run USB
  Netplay 0.1.3 or newer; otherwise compare the checksums at the bottom of
  each status screen. Then copy one handheld's core to the other.
- **Nothing on the other end.** Check that the OTG adapter is on the host and
  that you used the data port. Then open USB Netplay on both and read
  *Links now*.
- **A phone (USB tethering) or a USB Ethernet adapter.** USB Netplay only
  takes over links to other handhelds. A phone sharing its connection offers
  a gateway, and an Ethernet adapter has a maker-assigned MAC address, so both
  are left alone, and the status lists them as "not a handheld". On KNULLI,
  Batocera, AmberELEC, dArkOS and connman builds of ROCKNIX, a phone's link
  is renamed `tether0` so the network manager uses it as usual.
- **It joined over Wi-Fi.** The cable wasn't linked yet when you joined. Run
  USB Netplay to check the link, then rejoin.
- **Logs.** The installed copy lives in `/storage/.config/usb-netplay`
  (ROCKNIX, AmberELEC), `/userdata/system/usb-netplay` (KNULLI, Batocera) or
  `/opt/usb-netplay` (dArkOS). Its `usbnp.log` records every link change, and
  `last-run.txt` has the last status report.

### How it works

The short version:

1. The USB device side gets its own small subnet, picked from a hash of the
   handheld's machine id, and hands the host an address.
2. The host side finds the other handheld in one of three ways: from the USB
   serial number, by asking its DHCP server, or by trying known default
   addresses.
3. The host side adds only a /32 address and host routes, so Wi-Fi and its
   default route stay as they are.
4. A broadcast route makes RetroArch's LAN host list search over the cable.
5. A hosts entry, `usb-netplay`, points at whichever handheld is on the other
   end.

KNULLI's H700 kernel can't be a USB network device. For it, a small ADB
client on the host side tunnels the netplay connection through the firmware's
own ADB gadget. A udev rule and a background loop handle plug-ins, unplugs
and reboots.

The long version is in [docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md](docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md), and the
per-firmware research with sources is in
[docs/FIRMWARE_NOTES.md](docs/FIRMWARE_NOTES.md).

## Development

```sh
sh tests/run.sh    # shellcheck, dash syntax, shell tests on fake firmware trees, python tests
USBNP_TEST_SHELL="busybox ash" sh tests/run.sh
```

The shell tests run `usbnp` against fake copies of each firmware's files
(`tests/fixtures.sh`) with a dry-run hook, so nothing on the test machine is
touched. They check that setup followed by remove leaves every tree exactly
as it was. `tests/test_hlink.py` tests Handheld Link offline: its file
service on fake FunKey cards, the stream groups, and the host's ADB code
against a stand-in `adbd`. Building the Handheld Link OPK is described in
[handheld-link/README.md](handheld-link/README.md#building).

  (ArkOS/dArkOS, by editing the device tree). This is a separate project with
  a different approach, and not affiliated with it.
- Made with the help of an LLM coding assistant (Anthropic's Claude), under my
